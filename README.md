# Expenses_tracker_project

This project is a simple Expense Tracker developed using JavaScript and arrays to manage and record daily expenses. The application allows users to add, store, and calculate expenses dynamically. Each expense (such as food, travel, shopping, etc.) is stored as an object in an array with details like amount, category, and date.
